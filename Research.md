### 10.2 Metrics Calculation and Monitoring

#### 10.2.1 Token Usage Tracking
The system implements comprehensive token usage tracking through the `TokenCountingHandler` integrated with LlamaIndex:

```python
# Token counting integration
callback_manager = CallbackManager([
    TokenCountingHandler(),
    ToolUsageLogger()
])

# Rate limit optimized LLM settings
llm = AzureOpenAI(
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=2048,
    timeout=120,
    max_retries=5,
    additional_kwargs={"top_p": 0.95}
)

# Token efficiency calculation
def calculate_token_efficiency(baseline_tokens, optimized_tokens):
    return (baseline_tokens - optimized_tokens) / baseline_tokens * 100
```

The token efficiency is calculated using the formula: TE = (T_base - T_opt) / T_base × 100%, where T_base is the baseline token usage and T_opt is the optimized token usage.

#### 10.2.2 Rate Limit Compliance Monitoring
Rate limit compliance is tracked through the circuit breaker pattern implementation and retry mechanisms:

```python
class RateLimitHandler:
    async def handle_rate_limited_call(
        self, 
        func: Callable, 
        *args, 
        max_retries: int = 3,
        base_delay: float = 1.0,
        **kwargs
    ) -> Any:
        for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
            try:
                # Execute the function
                result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                if "rate limit" in str(e).lower() or "429" in str(e):
                    if attempt < max_retries:
                        # Retry with exponential backoff
                        wait_time = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)
                        await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
                        continue
                    else:
                        raise
                else:
                    raise
```

Rate limit compliance is calculated as: RLC = (R_success + R_retry_success) / R_total × 100%, where R_success is initially successful requests, R_retry_success is requests successful after retry, and R_total is total requests.

#### 10.2.3 Error Recovery Rate Calculation
The error recovery rate is tracked through the circuit breaker implementation and error handling mechanisms:

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    async def call(self, func: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        try:
            # Execute with timeout
            result = await asyncio.wait_for(
                func(*args, **kwargs), 
                timeout=self.config.timeout
            )
            await self._record_success()
            return result
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            await self._record_failure()
            raise CircuitBreakerTimeoutError(f"Execution timeout in '{self.name}'")
        except Exception as e:
            await self._record_failure()
            raise
```

Error recovery rate is calculated as: ERR = (E_handled + E_recovered) / E_total × 100%, where E_handled is errors successfully handled, E_recovered is errors recovered through retry/fallback, and E_total is total errors.

#### 10.2.4 Performance Metrics Collection
Performance metrics are collected through the analytics service that queries the database for time series data:

```python
async def get_performance_metrics(self, db: AsyncSession, days: int = 30) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    end_date = datetime.utcnow()
    start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=days)
    
    # Calculate average response time
    avg_response_time = await db.scalar(
        select(func.avg(Query.response_time)).where(Query.created_at >= start_date)
    )
    
    # Calculate success rate
    total_queries = await db.scalar(
        select(func.count(Query.id)).where(Query.created_at >= start_date)
    )
    successful_queries = await db.scalar(
        select(func.count(Query.id))
        .where(and_(Query.created_at >= start_date, Query.status == "completed"))
    )
    
    success_rate = (successful_queries / total_queries * 100) if total_queries > 0 else 0
    
    return {
        "average_response_time": avg_response_time,
        "success_rate": round(success_rate, 2)
    }
```

Average response time is calculated as: ART = Σ(T_response) / N_requests, where T_response is response time per request and N_requests is total number of requests.
